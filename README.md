# Octoco Technical Interview
## Description
A super simple web app, built using ReactJS and no prior React experience. The app displays a list of the top 10 cryptocurrencies and some additional details. You can click on a cryptocurrency to see more details about it.

## Requirements
This project was made using `npm 10.3.0` and `npx 10.3.0`.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dewet99/octoco-crypto-app.git
    ```
2. Get all the packages as listed in package-lock.json:
    ```bash
    npm ci
    ```

3. Run the following inside the clone repo:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
4. The web app should open automatically inside your default browser.

## Usage
Click on stuff until stuff happens. That's about the extent of the functionality.
